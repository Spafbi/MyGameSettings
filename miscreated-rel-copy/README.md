# Miscreated Release Copy CMD Script

I've created this script to help Miscreated QA Testers maintain separate copies
of the game for testing and playing the live release, respectively, to help
avoid potentially large downloads every time the want to switch between the
environments.

You will only need to update your release copy once every time an update or
hotfix is released by the dev team.

## How to use this script
